# Introduction to Jupiter Terminal

Jupiter Terminal is a lightweight, plug-and-play version of Jupiter that allows you to seamlessly integrate end-to-end swap functionality into your dApp with minimal effort. With just a few lines of code, you can embed a fully functional swap interface directly into your website.

## What is Jupiter Terminal?

Jupiter Terminal is an open-source solution that provides the same powerful swap experience found on jup.ag, but in a format that can be easily integrated into any website or application. It offers:

- **Seamless Integration**: Embed Jupiter's swap functionality directly into your dApp without redirects
- **Multiple Display Options**: Choose between integrated, widget, or modal display modes
- **Customizable Interface**: Configure the terminal to match your application's needs
- **Advanced Features**: Access to Ultra Mode with real-time slippage estimation, dynamic priority fees, and optimized transaction handling

## Key Features

### Ultra Mode Innovations

- **Real-time Slippage Estimation (RTSE)**: Leverages real-time swap data from actual users, historical trends, and heuristics to determine optimal slippage for each trade
- **Dynamic Priority Fees**: Estimates optimal transaction fees by analyzing network activity, swap size, and interactions with high-traffic accounts
- **Optimized Transaction Landing**: Fires transactions across multiple providers simultaneously, increasing the likelihood of successful execution
- **Jupiter Shield** (coming soon): Enhanced security features to safeguard swaps from potential risks in token selection

### Display Flexibility

Jupiter Terminal offers three display modes to suit different use cases:

1. **Integrated Mode**: Embeds the terminal directly into a specified container in your application
2. **Widget Mode**: Creates a floating widget that can be positioned in different corners of the screen
3. **Modal Mode**: Displays the terminal as a modal dialog that can be triggered by user actions

### Customization Options

- Configure initial tokens and amounts
- Lock input or output tokens for specific use cases
- Restrict token selection to a predefined list
- Style the terminal to match your application's design
- Set up event handlers for swap success and error scenarios

By integrating Jupiter Terminal into your dApp, you can provide users with a seamless, efficient swap experience while staying at the forefront of Solana DeFi innovation.
